# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

A comprehensive, AI-native textbook for teaching Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, created using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## Overview

This textbook provides a complete curriculum covering foundational concepts, ROS 2, simulation frameworks (Gazebo/Unity), NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) robotics, hardware lab setup, and capstone projects. Designed for university-level courses in robotics, AI, and embodied intelligence.
